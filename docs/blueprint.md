# **App Name**: ApexSwap

## Core Features:

- Simulated Trading: Allow users to simulate trades with real-time price feeds and order execution.
- Liquidity Pools: Enable users to add and remove liquidity from various token pairs, earning fees in the process.
- Staking and Farming: Implement staking pools where users can stake tokens to earn rewards, with options for single-asset staking and LP token farming.
- Transaction History: Maintain a complete transaction log with details such as transaction hash, type, tokens involved, amounts, and timestamps.
- Portfolio Dashboard: Provide users with an overview of their portfolio, including total value, asset allocation, and performance analytics.
- Impermanent Loss Prediction: The impermanent loss tool attempts to estimate the potential impermanent loss with the parameters that the user specifies. Because liquidity pool behavior is sensitive to sudden large fluctuations, it relies on past pool behavior as one of its indicators.
